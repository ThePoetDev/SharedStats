# SharedStats (Version 1.19.4)
SharedStats is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to share their health and hunger values. When this plugin is installed on your server, all players will have the same health and hunger levels. If one player takes damage or eats food, all players' health and hunger levels will be updated accordingly.

# Installation
To install SharedStats, simply download the latest release from the releases page and place the JAR file in your server's plugins folder.

# Usage
Once SharedStats is installed on your server, it will automatically start working. There are no commands or configuration options to worry about.

In addition to the shared health and hunger mechanics, this plugin also adds some new items and recipes to the game. These items can be used to increase the total amount of health that players have. You can find a list of these items from crafting table. They're added recipe book!
